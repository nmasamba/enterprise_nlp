    "\n",
    "Causal language models are frequently used for text generation. These models can be used for creative applications like choosing your own text adventure or for an intelligent coding assistant like Copilot or CodeParrot. Masked language models predict a masked token in a sequence, and the model can attend to tokens bidirectionally. This means the model has full access to the tokens on the left and right. Masked language modeling is great for tasks that require a good contextual understanding of an entire sequence. BERT is an example of a masked language model. \n",
